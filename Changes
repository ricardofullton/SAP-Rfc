  Completely renamed all modules to SAP::xxx standard - sorry guys
    but it is better to bite this one now than later!
  Fixed bug in structure discovery for interface discovery - it was not 
    always picking that a table had a structure.
  Fixed nasty bug in returning import parameter values.
  Created sample IDOC posting program for Purchase Orders

  Thanks to Frederic Huet who highlighted some bugs:
  Fixed - bad C code for import parameters
  Fixed discovery problem for Date and Time data types - these get a basic
    default value of zeros.

0.10  Sat Sep 11 22:00:00 1999
  Changed the structure routine to not pack and unpack the "whole" value
  all the time - now it keeps track of when component or overall value 
  changes in order to decide when to pack/unpack.

0.11  Sat Oct 04 19:00:00 1999
  Fixed a bug in date checking for Export parameter - did not allow 10 for
  month.
  Changed Structure.pm to default 0's for date and time data types if they are
  null.
  Cleaned up Rfc.xs to remove unused functions, and declarations.

0.12 Sometime on Monday Oct 25th 1999
  Johan Schon pointed out a problem with the t/test.t script $^W = 0 not undef.
  Fixed a problem with the discovery routines where the structures for the standard RFCs
    change between releases 3.x and 4.x+ ( RFC_GET* ).
  Used #defines to remove declarations from Rfc.xs that have caused problems with 
    compilation under Win32 - Fred.
 
0.15 Tuesday 16th  Nov 1999
  DJ sent in problems with warns coming up when using -W and use strict - a lot of these
    warnings have been fixed, but some may still exist?
  Major new release with the xml based rfc message passing ( perl <-> xs ), which also
    includes dynamic memory allocation for working storage - the method xmlrfc in Rfc.pm
    replaces callrfc if you choose to use this functionality.  callrfc remains untouched.
  dumpdef() Methods added to Interface.pm, Table.pm, Export.pm, and Import.pm to allow
    easy printing out of the object definitions - this is essentially a debugging tool.
 
 
0.16 Monday 22th  Nov 1999
  Sorry! - an annoying change has been made so that a $rfc->callrfc or a $rfc->xmlrfc now requires an arguement of an SAP::Interface object instead of the name of the interface.  This change is necessary to allow more than one instance of the same RFC call to be made within a threaded perl application.  This will eventually make the $rfc->addInterface, and $rfc->deleteInterface methods redundant, as the Interface object becomes divorced from the connectin object ( SAP::Rfc ).
  Introduced a new method in SAP::Interface to generate a code stub for a given interface - the method is $iface->Gencode($file);  It take a target source code file as an arguement.  The file is filled with a single method that returns a complete SAP::Interface object for the specified RFC Interface.  This is a time saver for complex interface definitions where you can't afford to have the overhead of using the $rfc->discover routine.
  The same method has been added to the SAP::Structure object so that structure definition code stubs can be automatically generated.  This is particularly useful for IDOC related programs that often will use many different and complex structures.  The examples program idoc.pl in the examples directory of the distribution generates a complete program stub for a given IDOC ( well worth a look ! ).

0.91 Tuesday 20th March, 2001

Added in a module SAP::SOAP that uses SOAP::Lite to support SOAP requests

Tidied up the documentation a bit as it is way out of date.

0.96 Fri Dec 28 13:35:17 GMT 2001 

Fixed a problem with sub nextRow in SAP::Iface, which was due to earlier changes in SAP::Struc.
